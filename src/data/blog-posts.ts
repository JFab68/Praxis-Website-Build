      # Our Fifth Year in the Fight for Independent Oversight

      As we approach the 2025 legislative session, momentum continues to build with Governor Hobbs' Executive Order and growing lawmaker support for independent oversight of Arizona's corrections system.

      ## Legislative Progress

      Our bill is returning to the 2025 legislative session with unprecedented bipartisan support. The groundwork laid by Governor Hobbs' Executive Order has created a strong foundation for comprehensive oversight reform.

      ## Executive Order Impact

      Governor Hobbs' Executive Order establishing preliminary oversight measures has demonstrated the immediate positive impact of external monitoring. Initial findings have reinforced the urgent need for permanent, independent oversight.

      ## Growing Support

      Current discussions with lawmakers show increasing recognition of oversight's importance. The oversight committee's recent report has provided compelling evidence for reform, strengthening our position heading into January.

      ## Looking Ahead

      With the 2025 session approaching, we're optimistic about achieving our goal of establishing permanent, independent oversight of Arizona's corrections system. The combination of executive support, legislative momentum, and public awareness creates an unprecedented opportunity for meaningful reform.
