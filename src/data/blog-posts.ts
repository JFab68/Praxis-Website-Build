# Our Fifth Year in the Fight for Independent Oversight

As we approach the 2025 legislative session, momentum continues to build with Governor Hobbs' Executive Order and growing lawmaker support for independent oversight of Arizona's corrections system.

## Legislative Progress

Our bill is returning to the 2025 legislative session with unprecedented bipartisan support. The groundwork laid by Governor Hobbs' Executive Order has created a strong foundation for comprehensive oversight reform.

## Executive Order Impact

Governor Hobbs' Executive Order establishing preliminary oversight measures has demonstrated the immediate positive impact of external monitoring. Initial findings have reinforced the urgent need for permanent, independent oversight.

## Growing Support

Current discussions with lawmakers show increasing recognition of oversight's importance. The oversight committee's recent report has provided compelling evidence for reform, strengthening our position heading into January.

## Looking Ahead

With the 2025 session approaching, we're optimistic about achieving our goal of establishing permanent, independent oversight of Arizona's corrections system. The combination of executive support, legislative momentum, and public awareness creates an unprecedented opportunity for meaningful reform.

# Breaking the Cycle: A New Approach to Recovery

Evidence-based practices and risk mitigation strategies are transforming recovery support nationwide, offering new hope and proven results.

## Medicated Assistant Treatment Overview

Recent advances in medicated assistant treatment have shown remarkable success rates, particularly when combined with comprehensive support services and individualized care plans.

## Evidence-Based Practices

Nationwide implementation of evidence-based practices has demonstrated significant improvements in recovery outcomes. Risk mitigation strategies have proven particularly effective in supporting long-term recovery success.

## Specialized Support Programs

Our Substance Use Disorder Trained (SUDT) doula program provides specialized support for expecting mothers, combining recovery support with comprehensive prenatal and postpartum care.

## Future Implementation

Plans are underway to expand these successful programs into jails and prisons, ensuring continuity of care and support for individuals throughout their recovery journey.
